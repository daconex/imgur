The easiest way to upload to imgur. 

Imgur Upload is a client side anonymous imgur upload client that is written in plain vanilla javascript. It's designed to be simple to use: drag a single image and get a imgur image link OR drag a group of images and get an album link.

Use `master` branch for development (pull requests) and `gh-pages` branch for release.
